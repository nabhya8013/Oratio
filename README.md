# Oratio

A system for computational oratory synthesis and cognitive response evaluation.

## About The Project

Oratio is an advanced system designed to help users improve their public speaking and oratory skills. It leverages a suite of computational tools to analyze various facets of a speech, from the spoken words to the emotional tone. By providing a simulated environment and detailed feedback, Oratio aims to be a comprehensive training platform for speakers of all levels.

The project is built with a microservice-based architecture, with distinct layers for presentation, processing, and analysis, making it a robust and scalable solution.

## Features

  * **Speech-to-Text Transcription:** Converts spoken language into text for analysis.
  * **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):** Detects the presence of speech in an audio stream.
  * **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER):** Analyzes the emotional tone of the speaker's voice.
  * **Similarity Analysis:** Compares the user's speech to a script or reference text.
  * **Interactive 3D Environment:** A Unity-based application provides a virtual stage for users to practice their speeches.

## Architecture

Oratio's architecture is divided into the following layers:

  * **ApplicationLayer:** The frontend of the system, developed in Unity. This layer provides an interactive 3D environment for users to deliver their speeches.

  * **PreSpeechLayer:** A Go-based backend that manages user sessions, and prepares the system for speech analysis. It appears to interact with external services like Gemini and Supabase for additional functionalities.

  * **PostSpeechLayer:** This layer is responsible for the post-analysis of the speech, including cognitive response evaluation.

  * **Python Services:** A collection of Python-based microservices that form the core of Oratio's speech analysis capabilities:

      * `vad_asr_service`: Handles Voice Activity Detection and Automatic Speech Recognition.
      * `extract_features_service`: Extracts relevant features from the audio data for further analysis.
      * `analyze_ser_service`: Performs Speech Emotion Recognition to gauge the emotional tone of the speech.
      * `analyze_similarity_service`: Analyzes the similarity between the user's speech and a provided text.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nabhya8013/oratio.git
    ```
2.  **Set up the different layers:**
      * **ApplicationLayer:** Open the project in Unity and run the scene.
      * **PreSpeechLayer:** Navigate to the `PreSpeechLayer` directory and run the Go application.
      * **Python Services:** Each service in the `python_services` directory will need to be run independently. They are likely Flask or FastAPI applications.
